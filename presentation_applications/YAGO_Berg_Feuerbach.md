# 1. **Introduction** 

## 1.1 Ontologies (Recap):

- Formal Representation: Structured definitions of concepts and relationships

- Shared Vocabulary: Common language for effective data exchange

- Knowledge Integration: Unifies diverse data sources for a cohesive view

- Reasoning and Inference: Enables logical reasoning to derive new knowledge

---

# 1. **Introduction**

## 1.2 Motivation and history

- Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr√ºcken saw potential of knowledge bases

- Already had various application fields

- Criticized that applications only utilized a single source of knowledge, often either WordNet or Wikipedia

- Laid out what features and traits a heavily improved application should have:
  - High accuracy (close to 100 %)
  - Combination of concepts and entities
  - Extensible, easily re-usable, and application independent

# 1. **Introduction** 

## 1.3 Yet Another Great Ontology (YAGO):

- Knowledge Base: Contains well over millions of entities and facts from real world

- Entities and Relations: Includes entities and their relationships
  - e.g. who played in which movie, which city is located in which country

- Class Taxonomy: Organizes entities in different hierarchical classes
  - e.g. class of cities is a subclass of the class of populated places

- Defined Relations: Specifies relations between entities, forming the ontology
  - e.g. birthPlace can only be between person and a place

# 1. **Introduction** 

## 1.3 Yet Another Great Ontology (YAGO):

- Wikidata's vast facts are combined with schema.org's ontology

- All identifiers are human-readable and comparable easy to understand

- Logical constraints maintain data quality and enables reasoning over the data

- Simpler version of Wikidata, offering a cleaner knowledge base

---

# 2. **Versions of YAGO**

## 2.1 YAGO 1

- First version of YAGO, created in 2007

- Unifies facts from Wikipedia with clean taxonomy from WordNet

- Categories from Wikipedia are brought together with nouns from WordNet

- 2 million entities and 20 million facts

---

# 2. **Versions of YAGO**

## 2.2 YAGO2

- Improvement in 2012

- "anchoring [...] along both the spatial and the temporal dimensions" (Hoffart et al. 2012, p. 3)

- *When and where was a fact true?*

- Introduction of *SPOTL(X)* for representing and querying "spatio-temporally enhanced facts" (Hoffart et al. 2012, p. 3)

- Time (or time frame) for entities and facts

- Single geo--coordinate pair for *geo-entities*

- 9.8 million entities and 447 million facts

- Coverage: Time 47 %, location 30 %

# 2. **Versions of YAGO**

## 2.3 YAGO2s

- Refactoring of YAGO2 in 2013

- Transparent and modular architecture

- Compliance of YAGO syntax with RDF

- Usage of Turtle format

- Introduction of domains from WordNet

---

# 2. **Versions of YAGO**

## 2.4 YAGO3

- Improvement in 2015

- Expansion into Wikipedias in other languages

- Use of Wikidata to identify same entities in different-language Wikipedias

- Fact extraction from infoboxes in Wikipedia

- 17 million entities and more than 150 million facts

---

# 2. **Versions of YAGO**

## 2.5 YAGO4

- Complete overhaul in 2020

- WordNet is abandoned, replaced by Schema.org

- Focus on Wikidata instead of Wikipedia infoboxes

- Browser and SPARQL endpoint are available

- Upper classes from Schema.org and selected lower classes from Wikidata

- 67 million entities and 343 million facts (Full YAGO)

---

# 2. **Versions of YAGO**

## 2.6 YAGO4.5

- Addresses issues of YAGO4

- Paper has been published this year (2024)

- Important principles:
  - Upper taxonomy to define properties
  - Lower taxonomy to convey information in human-readable form

- 49 million entities and 132 million facts

---

# 3. **Applications**

## 3.1 Various examples

- NER: Enhances entity recognition with structured data
  
- Semantic Web: Builds knowledge graphs for data linking
  
- AI Chatbots: Improves chatbot responses with factual data
  
- Knowledge Graphs: Maps complex entity relationships
  
- NLP: Supports semantic analysis and word disambiguation

---

# 3. **Applications**

## 3.2 IBM Watson

- The most known application of YAGO is IBM Watson
  
- IBM Watson is a system capable of answering questions
  
- Developed by at IBM, team led by David Ferucci, released in 2011
  
- Designed to answer questions from the TV show Jeopardy

- IBM Watson actually beat the real champions and won

---

# 3. **Applications**

## 3.2 IBM Watson

- Created as a question-answering system using NLP, IR and other technologies

- Written in languages including Java, C++ and Prolog, and runs on Linux servers

- The system Watson uses has 2,880 processor threads and 16 TB of RAM

- The data Watson uses includes encyclopaedias, dictionaries, articles and more

- Also databases, taxonomies and ontologies as DBPedia, WordNet and **YAGO**

# 4. **YAGO and SPARQL**

```sql
PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
PREFIX yago: <http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?movie ?duration WHERE {
  ?movie rdf:type schema:Movie .
  ?movie schema:duration ?duration .
  FILTER (xsd:decimal(?duration) >= 100)
}
LIMIT 3
```

# 5. **Comparison**

- YAGO vs. DBpedia: Fixed schema, non-redundant relations, 50m vs. 4m instances

- YAGO vs. ConceptNet: Focus on specific instances, not common sense knowledge

- YAGO vs. BabelNet: Structured taxonomy and defined schema

- YAGO vs. Freebase: Actively maintained with ongoing updates

- YAGO vs. Wikidata: Readable identifiers, clean taxonomy, logical constraints

---

# 6. **Conclusion**

- **Combines Strengths**: Merges Wikidata's facts with schema.org's ontology

- **User-Friendly**: Has human-readable identifiers and well-organized classifications

- **Streamlined Data**: Includes only well-populated, essential classes and properties

- **Logical Constraints**: Ensures data quality and supports advanced reasoning
